## Feature Developed ##
The main that I have developed is ** Teacher's Comments**. For primary school students, their parents should know the day-to-day activities/homework/Awards etc. By using this feature teachers will be able to post comments on student's profiles. The comments are divided into 4 categories (todo, awards, notifications, and doubts), for more understandability and filtering (future Scope).

### Changes From Assignment - 2 ###
* Categories to the comments have been added as a modification.
* Secondary Navbar and Overall performance tab are dropped because as a group we decided not to pursue the QUIZ feature, and overall performance was highly dependent on that.


### NOTE ###
While integrating the main features we discovered that there are many background features and tasks that we need to create. These features are important to give wholesome look and complete task flow to the application. 
We decided to divide these features and develop them as a team. My features are mentioned below:
* Main Navigation Bar
* Landing Page
