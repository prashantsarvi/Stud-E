Feature: 

Question & Answers (Q n A)

The Q n A feature is where the content regarding a particular chapter is provided by the teacher to the students. This feature is very useful to the students who have missed the classes and also during examination for revision purpose. Most of the questions in the examinations are asked from this section. So, this section of the student portal is of great importance for the student’s grade.
The Q n A section for the teachers is editable where the teachers update the new questions of the chapters daily according to the curriculum of the course. In this way, the students will be updated with the latest content and help them to get a better grip on the subject. The student can view question and answers of a particular subject and course by selecting the appropriate course from the My Courses section in the navTabs and then selecting the desired chapter [1].

Note: We were previously using SideNav for our StudE web application but as the team discussed and chose to opt for more readability, 
the team has decided to shift to NavTabs.
